# blackadder
A light version of blackadder ICN stack, including only core components that I wrote once upon a time (and swig-based wrappers written by Jimmy Kjallman):

--the actual ICN stack

--C++ library

--Topology Manager

--deployment tool (+some code from Dimitris)

--sample applications

--some fountain coding stuff
