Blackadder Universal Deployment Tool
------------------------------------

How to build:
 
 Invoke the make directly, you system must have already installed:
   - igraph library
   - libconfig http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/
   - TCLAP template library http://tclap.sourceforge.net/


How to run:

  The deployment tool accepts types of configuration files as mandatory arguments: 
     - blackadder configuration file format that describes nodes and their connectivity (graph)

  How to invoke the tool using the first configuration file:
   ./deploy -c <config file>

 In the second case the tool will produce autogenerated.cfg and edgevertices.cfg.  
 The files are stored in the WRITE_CONF folder which is designated in the configuration file.

 Other functions:
  
 The tool accepts a .tgz file which tranfers to all nodes and decompresses at the remote user home folder:
 ./deploy -c <config file> i[-t <filename>.tgz]


BlackAdder Planetlab Albert Barabasi topology generator tool Version 0.1
------------------------------------------------

How to run:

  The program takes as input the following configuration files (mandatory): 
     - Blackadder Configuration file format that describes only available nodes. The tool will built a random graph for these nodes using
       the barabasi-albert model.

  The program outputs the following configuration files (mandatory): 
     -   Blackadder deployment tool Configuration file format that describes nodes and their connectivity (graph). Edgevertices config that reports the autogenerated graph leaves.


  How to invoke the tool using the  configuration file:
   ./baplanetlabtool -c <config file> -o <out config file>

 The tool produces <out config file>.cfg and <out config file>.edgevertices.cfg.  
 The files are ommited in the WRITE_CONF folder which is designated in the configuration file.
 <out config file>.cfg is a blackadder deployment tool configuration file  that represents a connectivity graph. 
 <out config file>.edgevertices.cfg contain the leaf nodes of the autogenerated barabasi graph to use them
 in experiment deployment.

 
 Planetlab specific file planetlabgetnodes.py
 --------------------------------------------

  This is a python script that works for planetlab-eu accounts.
  Edit the file and add your credentials in the Auth Dictionary field.

  Just execute the file: python planetlabgetnodes.py
  The tool will resolve all IPs and build config type 2 format
  of the available planetlab nodes.
